To run the page:
1) If you do not already have, install Python 3.5 (or upper) and the dependencies listed in "environment.yml" (if you use conda, you can create a new environment directly from the file).
2) Open a terminal. Use cd to move at the root of the project folder.
3) Launch: $ bokeh serve example --show
(It will run a tornado server on your localhost and automatically open a browser page on the corresponding address)
